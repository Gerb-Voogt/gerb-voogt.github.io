Laplace transform are a versatile and powerful integral transform with broad applications. Among these applications is solving initial value problems. The aim of this article is to explore the connection between the between Laplace transforms and power series expansion to show that the Laplace transform can be thought of as a continuous analogue of the familiar Taylor series!
