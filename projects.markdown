### Model Predictive Control for a 2DoF Robotic Manipulator

---
Designed a and simulated a controller for a 2DoF robotic manipulator by taking a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach. 


### 6502 Microprocessor Emulator Written in C++

---
An emulator for the classic 6502 microprocessor. 


### Preconditioner Selection for Space-time discretized Navier-Stokes Equations

---
As part of my degree I did a minor in computational science and engineering. Courses in this minor included numerical methods for partial differential equations and scientific programming in C++. The project part of the minor involved the analysis of several different pre-conditioner options for space-time discretized Navier-Stokes equations.
